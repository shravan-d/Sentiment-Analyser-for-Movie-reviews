 Not bad but not great.
 So many whiney reviews
 Looks very impressive!
 Empty..
 I REALLY did keep an open mind...
 Read This Before You Review This Remake
 If Anything, It's a Monumental Technical Achievement
 Great Movie
 THE VISUAL WAS STUNNING AND BREATHTAKING.
 Disaster
 Nice CGI. That's it.
 What a shame
 To all the people giving this movie 1 star...y'all are idiots
 A plane ticket to Africa might have helped that movie
 Need a new writer
 A massively disappointing live-action adaptation that serves as inferior to the original, with no further improvement
 I felt nothing.
 The original movie was more than enough.
 Just to make money, nothing else mattered here
 Disney = money
 No reason
 Why was this made?
 Emotionless techdemo of the new technologies en advancements in CGI Rendering
 Rather than a Lion King, this is a Copy-Cat King
 Disney Greed
